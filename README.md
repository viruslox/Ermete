# Ermete: Discord Voice Bot with Real-Time Audio Processing

Ermete is a Discord bot designed for real-time audio processing and playback.
It utilizes the PortAudio library for audio I/O and Opus for audio encoding, enabling (possibly) seamless interaction with Discord voice channels.
This bot scope is live audio streaming.

## ‚ú® Features
- Join and Leave Commands: Easily control the bot's presence in voice channels.
- Real-Time Audio Streaming: Captures input from your microphone and streams it directly to Discord voice channels.
- Opus Encoding: Efficiently encodes audio for Discord's voice API.
- Custom Audio Processing: Extendable structure to add real-time audio effects or manipulations.


## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites:
- Go (1.18+ recommended)
- PortAudio library installed on your system
- A Discord bot token

### Environment variables:
- GOLIVE_BOT_TOKEN: Your bot's token

### Installation (Compile)
- (ONLY this step as root) install required libraries
apt install git portaudio19-dev libopus-dev libopusfile-dev opus-tools

- Prepare folder
mkdir -p ~/go/src/ && cd ~/go/src/

- Download the source:
git clone https://github.com/viruslox/Ermete

- Install dependencies
- 	cd ~/go/src/Ermete/
- 	go mod init
- 	go mod tidy

- Build the bot:
go build ./cmd/Ermete

- Run the bot: 
Create a launch script where to set Env viarables (check the launch_ermete.sh template for hints)
wget https://github.com/viruslox/Ermete/blob/main/launch_ermete.sh

- Edit the script before use it
./launch_ermete.sh

### Installation (Binary download)
- Download last release from https://github.com/viruslox/Ermete/releases/
- Copy it somewhere like ~/Ermete/
- Create a launch script where to set Env viarables (check the launch_ermete.sh template for hints)

## üõ† Usage (Discord commands)

### Join a Voice Channel:
Use gl.join <channelID> to make the bot join a voice channel.

### Leave a Voice Channel:
Use gl.leave to make the bot disconnect.

### Shutdown the Bot:
Use gl.shutdown (admin only) to stop the bot.

## üìö Architecture
### Core Components
- Input Device: Captures audio from the user's microphone using PortAudio.
- Opus Encoder: Encodes captured audio into Opus format for Discord compatibility.
- Output Device: Plays audio received from the Discord voice channel back to the user.

### Extendable Design
The project uses interfaces (ErmeteInput and ErmeteOutput) to abstract input/output devices.
This design allows for easy integration of additional audio processing features or support for alternative audio backends.
