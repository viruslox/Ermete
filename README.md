# Ermete: Discord Voice Bot with Real-Time Audio Processing

Ermete is a Discord bot designed for real-time audio processing and playback. It utilizes the PortAudio library for audio I/O and Opus for audio encoding, enabling (possibly) seamless interaction with Discord voice channels. This bot scope is live audio streaming.

‚ú® Features
Join and Leave Commands: Easily control the bot's presence in voice channels.
Real-Time Audio Streaming: Captures input from your microphone and streams it directly to Discord voice channels.
Opus Encoding: Efficiently encodes audio for Discord's voice API.
Custom Audio Processing: Extendable structure to add real-time audio effects or manipulations.

üìö Architecture
Core Components
Input Device: Captures audio from the user's microphone using PortAudio.
Opus Encoder: Encodes captured audio into Opus format for Discord compatibility.
Output Device: Plays audio received from the Discord voice channel back to the user.
Extendable Design
The project uses interfaces (ErmeteInput and ErmeteOutput) to abstract input/output devices. This design allows for easy integration of additional audio processing features or support for alternative audio backends.
